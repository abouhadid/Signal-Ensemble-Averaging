# Signal-Ensemble-Averaging
Signal ensemble averaging is a technique used in signal processing to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by averaging multiple repetitions or instances of a signal. This method is particularly useful when dealing with signals that are corrupted by random noise or other sources of variability.

Applying ensemble averaging improves the SNR of the signal by the square root of the N (the number of repetitions). Also, the final signal data are less prone to random noise.

Here, we test **Ensemble Averaging** to determine the Visual Evoked Response (VER) based on repetitive stimulation with specified timing.
